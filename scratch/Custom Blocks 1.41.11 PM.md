Writing a custom block for Scratch requires understanding the underlying language, specifically the ScratchScript language. I'll provide a general guide on how to create a

custom block for each of the missing functionalities:

  

**1. Try-Catch Blocks**

  

To write a try-catch block in Scratch, you can use the following code structure:

```scratchscript

let error_msg = ""

try {

// Code that might throw an error

} catch (e) {

error_msg = e.name + ": " + e.message

}

```

This code attempts to execute the code inside the try block. If an error occurs, it catches the error and sets the `error_msg` variable.

  

To create a custom block:

  

1. Open Scratch and click on "New" > "Custom Block".

2. Name your block (e.g., "try-catch").

3. Create a new script by clicking on the "Script" tab.

4. Copy the try-catch code structure into the script.

5. Save and test the block.

  

**Example:**

  

Your custom block should look like this:

```

Block: Try-Catch

Script:

let error_msg = ""

try {

// Code that might throw an error

} catch (e) {

error_msg = e.name + ": " + e.message

}

[error_msg]

```

**2. Switch Statements**

  

To write a switch statement in Scratch, you can use the following code structure:

```scratchscript

let result = ""

switch (variable) {

case value1:

result = "Value 1"

case value2:

result = "Value 2"

default:

result = "Default"

}

```

This code evaluates the `variable` and assigns a corresponding value to `result`.

  

To create a custom block:

  

1. Open Scratch and click on "New" > "Custom Block".

2. Name your block (e.g., "switch").

3. Create a new script by clicking on the "Script" tab.

4. Copy the switch code structure into the script.

5. Save and test the block.

  

**Example:**

  

Your custom block should look like this:

```

Block: Switch

Script:

let result = ""

switch (variable) {

case value1:

result = "Value 1"

case value2:

result = "Value 2"

default:

result = "Default"

}

[result]

```

**3. Lambda Functions**

  

To write a lambda function in Scratch, you can use the following code structure:

```scratchscript

let func = (arg) => {

// Function body

}

```

This code defines a small anonymous function that takes one argument.

  

To create a custom block:

  

1. Open Scratch and click on "New" > "Custom Block".

2. Name your block (e.g., "lambda").

3. Create a new script by clicking on the "Script" tab.

4. Copy the lambda code structure into the script.

5. Save and test the block.

  

**Example:**

  

Your custom block should look like this:

```

Block: Lambda

Script:

let func = (arg) => {

// Function body

}

[func]

```

Note that lambda functions in Scratch are used as arguments to other blocks, so you'll need to specify the function's name and parameters.

  

**4. Arrays with Indexing**

  

To write an array with indexing in Scratch, you can use the following code structure:

```scratchscript

let arr = [1, 2, 3]

arr[0] = 10

```

This code creates a new array and assigns values to specific indices.

  

To create a custom block:

  

1. Open Scratch and click on "New" > "Custom Block".

2. Name your block (e.g., "array-assign").

3. Create a new script by clicking on the "Script" tab.

4. Copy the array code structure into the script.

5. Save and test the block.

  

**Example:**

  

Your custom block should look like this:

```

Block: Array Assign

Script:

let arr = [1, 2, 3]

arr[0] = 10

[arr]

```

**5. Dictionaries/Maps**

  

To write a dictionary/map in Scratch, you can use the following code structure:

```scratchscript

let dict = {

"key1": "value1",

"key2": "value2"

}

dict["new_key"] = "new_value"

```

This code creates a new dictionary and assigns values to specific keys.

  

To create a custom block:

  

1. Open Scratch and click on "New" > "Custom Block".

2. Name your block (e.g., "dictionary-assign").

3. Create a new script by clicking on the "Script" tab.

4. Copy the dictionary code structure into the script.

5. Save and test the block.

  

**Example:**

  

Your custom block should look like this:

```

Block: Dictionary Assign

Script:

let dict = {

"key1": "value1",

"key2": "value2"

}

dict["new_key"] = "new_value"

[dict]

```

**6. Sets**

  

To write a set in Scratch, you can use the following code structure:

```scratchscript

let set = {

"value1",

"value2",

"value3"

}

set.add("new_value")

```

This code creates a new set and adds values to it.

  

To create a custom block:

  

1. Open Scratch and click on "New" > "Custom Block".

2. Name your block (e.g., "set-add").

3. Create a new script by clicking on the "Script" tab.

4. Copy the set code structure into the script.

5. Save and test the block.

  

**Example:**

  

Your custom block should look like this:

```

Block: Set Add

Script:

let set = {

"value1",

"value2",

"value3"

}

set.add("new_value")

[set]

```

Note that sets in Scratch are used as collections of unique values.

  

**7. Type Casting**

  

To write a type cast in Scratch, you can use the following code structure:

```scratchscript

let value = 10

let result = value as int

```

This code casts the `value` variable to an integer.

  

To create a custom block:

  

1. Open Scratch and click on "New" > "Custom Block".

2. Name your block (e.g., "typecast").

3. Create a new script by clicking on the "Script" tab.

4. Copy the type cast code structure into the script.

5. Save and test the block.

  

**Example:**

  

Your custom block should look like this:

```

Block: Type Cast

Script:

let value = 10

let result = value as int

[result]

```

Note that type casting in Scratch is used to specify the data type of a variable.

  

**8. Default Value**

  

To write a default value in Scratch, you can use the following code structure:

```scratchscript

let result = value || "default_value"

```

This code assigns a default value to `result` if `value` is null or undefined.

  

To create a custom block:

  

1. Open Scratch and click on "New" > "Custom Block".

2. Name your block (e.g., "coalesce").

3. Create a new script by clicking on the "Script" tab.

4. Copy the default value code structure into the script.

5. Save and test the block.

  

**Example:**

  

Your custom block should look like this:

```

Block: Coalesce

Script:

let result = value || "default_value"

[result]

```
